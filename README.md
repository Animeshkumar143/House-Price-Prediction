# House-Price-Prediction

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. Using a dataset of historical housing prices, the model is trained to identify patterns and make accurate predictions for future listings. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

**Key Features**:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming features to improve model performance.
Model Training: Implementing and training various machine learning models.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of models using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².
Predictions: Generating price predictions for new data entries.

**Technologies Used**:
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)

**How to Use**:
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies.
Run the provided Jupyter notebooks to see the data analysis, model training, and predictions in action.
